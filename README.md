# HostileSubBruteforcer
This app will bruteforce for exisiting subdomains and provide the following information:
   - IP address
   - Host
   - if the 3rd party host has been properly setup. (for example if site.example.com is poiting to a nonexisiting Heroku subdomain, it'll alert you) -> Currently only works with AWS, Github, Heroku and squarespace.

There may be some false positives depending on the host configurations.

Good luck!
